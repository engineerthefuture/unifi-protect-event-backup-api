  title: Unifi Protect Event Backup API
  description: |
    AWS Lambda function that receives and processes webhook events from Unifi Dream Machine Protect systems, 
    storing alarm event data and video files in S3 for backup and analysis.
    
    ## Features
    - Real-time webhook processing from Unifi Protect systems
    - Secure S3 storage with date-organized folder structure
    - Device MAC address to human-readable name mapping
    - RESTful event retrieval API
    - Direct video file download with optimized search
    - Comprehensive CORS support for web clients
    
    ## Architecture
    This serverless application uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 to provide a scalable, 
    cost-effective solution for backing up Unifi Protect alarm events and video files. Events are automatically 
    organized by date and enriched with device names for easy identification. Video files are downloaded
    directly from Unifi Protect and stored alongside event metadata.
    
    ## Video Download Optimization
    The latest video endpoint uses an efficient search algorithm that leverages the date-organized
    folder structure in S3. Instead of scanning all objects, it starts from today's date folder
    and works backwards day by day until a video is found, making retrieval fast and cost-effective.
    
    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` header. The API key is generated 
    during CloudFormation deployment and can be retrieved from the AWS API Gateway console.
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    API Gateway enforces rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse. Default limits are:
    - Burst: 5000 requests
    - Rate: 10000 requests per second
    
    ## Data Retention
    Events are stored indefinitely in S3. Configure S3 lifecycle policies for automatic archival 
    or deletion based on your retention requirements.

      summary: Process Unifi Protect alarm webhook
      description: |
        Receives and processes webhook events from Unifi Dream Machine Protect systems.
        
        **Processing Steps:**
        1. Validates incoming JSON payload structure
        2. Extracts alarm triggers and device information
        3. Maps device MAC addresses to human-readable names
        4. Generates unique event keys and timestamps
        5. Stores enriched event data in S3 with date-based organization
        6. Returns success confirmation with event details
        
        **Storage Format:**
        Events are stored as JSON files in S3 with the path structure:
        `{bucket}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{deviceMac}_{timestamp}.json`
        
        **Error Handling:**
        - Malformed JSON returns 400 Bad Request
        - Missing required fields return 400 Bad Request
        - Server errors return 500 Internal Server Error
        - All errors include descriptive error messages

        - **Allow-Origin**: `*` (configurable for production)
        - **Allow-Methods**: `OPTIONS, POST, GET`
        - **Allow-Headers**: `Content-Type, X-API-Key`
        - **Max-Age**: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
        
        **Usage:**
        Web browsers automatically send OPTIONS requests before cross-origin POST/GET requests.
        This endpoint ensures proper CORS headers are returned to allow web applications to
        interact with the API from different domains.

      summary: Retrieve stored alarm event
      description: |
        Retrieves a previously stored alarm event by its unique event key.
        
        **Event Key Format:**
        Event keys follow the pattern: `{deviceMac}_{timestamp}.json`
        - **deviceMac**: 12-character hexadecimal MAC address (no separators)
        - **timestamp**: Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the event occurred
        - **.json**: File extension indicating JSON format
        
        **Storage Location:**
        Events are stored in S3 with date-based organization:
        `s3://{bucket}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{eventKey}`
        
        **Response Data:**
        Returns the complete event data including:
        - Original alarm information from Unifi Protect
        - Enriched data (device names, formatted timestamps)
        - Event metadata (storage location, retrieval links)
        
        **Use Cases:**
        - Event lookup by timestamp and device
        - Integration with monitoring dashboards
        - Historical event analysis
        - Audit trail reconstruction

    get:
      summary: Get latest video download URL
      description: |
        Finds the most recent video file (.mp4) from stored alarm events and returns a presigned URL for download.
        
        **Why Presigned URL?**
        Video files typically exceed API Gateway's 6MB payload limit, so instead of returning the video data directly,
        this endpoint returns a secure, time-limited URL that allows direct download from S3. This approach is more
        efficient and can handle videos of any size.
        
        **Search Algorithm:**
        This endpoint uses an optimized search that efficiently searches through date-organized 
        folders in S3 to find the most recent video file. It starts from today's date folder 
        and works backwards day by day until a video is found, making it much more efficient 
        than scanning all objects in the bucket.
        
        **Search Process:**
        1. Start from today's date folder (YYYY-MM-DD format)
        2. Search for .mp4 files in that folder
        3. If found, return metadata for the one with the highest timestamp
        4. If not found, move to previous day and repeat
        5. Continue for up to 30 days maximum
        
        **File Format:**
        Video files follow the naming pattern: `{deviceMac}_{timestamp}.mp4`
        - **deviceMac**: 12-character hexadecimal MAC address
        - **timestamp**: Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the event occurred
        
        **Storage Organization:**
        Videos are stored in S3 with date-based organization:
        `s3://{bucket}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{deviceMac}_{timestamp}.mp4`
        
        **Response Format:**
        Returns JSON containing:
        - **downloadUrl**: Presigned S3 URL for direct download (expires in 1 hour)
        - **filename**: Suggested filename for download
        - **metadata**: Event timestamp, date, and video key information
        - **eventData**: Complete alarm event details including device name, trigger type, zones, and timestamps
        
        **Security:**
        - Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour for security
        - URLs include proper Content-Disposition headers for filename handling
        - Direct S3 access without requiring API credentials
        
        **Use Cases:**
        - Quick access to most recent security footage
        - Automated monitoring systems that can handle URLs
        - Mobile applications for security alerts
        - Integration with notification systems

        API key required for all requests. 
        
        **Obtaining API Key:**
        1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack
        2. Retrieve from AWS API Gateway console
        3. Or use AWS CLI: `aws apigateway get-api-keys --include-values`
        
        **Usage:**
        Include in all requests as a header:
        ```
        X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
        ```
        
        **Security Notes:**
        - Keep API keys secure and rotate regularly
        - Use different keys for different environments
        - Monitor API key usage in CloudWatch
